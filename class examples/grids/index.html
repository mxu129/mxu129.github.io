      <h1>From Traditional to E-Shopping</h1>

      <body>
        <p>Online shopping is the way to go for people now days. In modern and fast life most people do not have time for traditional shopping. Online shopping allows you to shop from any place and at any time. It's easier to compare prices and find
          a better deal. Many online sites offer discount coupons and rebates, as well. If you are not familiar with online shopping sites, here you will find a few of my favorite.

        <p class="grid1-text1">It's a fleeting moment, but a joyful one: The Palm Beach County animal shelter's main kennel, typically teeming with unwanted dogs, is empty.</p>

        <p class="grid1-text2">The kennel, one of three, is typically full with 48 dogs, which sometimes have to double up in their runs when space is at a premium. But thanks to a wave of adoptions and foster volunteers due to coronavirus, Kennel

    <h2>Why Adopt?</h2>
    <p>There are many advantages of adopting a rescue dog that you and your family can enjoy.</p>


    <h4>You are Saving A Life</h4>

    <li>Adopting a dog from a shelter not only means that you’re giving him a happy life, but you also free up a spot at the rescue or shelter to save another dog’s life.</li>

    <h4>You Can Find A Fully Trained Dog</h4>
    <li>Don’t know much about training a puppy or don’t have the patience? You can find an adult rescue dog who’s already house trained and has his basic manners down pat. But if you’re up to the challenge, a rescue can find you a puppy as well.</li>

    <h4>Rescue Dogs Are Often Less Expensive To Adopt</h4>
    <li>A rescue dog has already had all of his vaccinations and may have been spayed or neutered. And shelters typically have very reasonable adoption fees, ranging from $50 to $300.</li>

    <h4>You Will Find A Lot Of Choices</h4>
    <li>Rescue shelters often have dogs of all ages and genders, as well as purebred and mixed breeds of all kinds (an estimated 30% of dogs in rescues are purebred). And if you have a specific breed in mind, reach out to a breed-specific rescue near
      you.</li>

    <h4>Helps Fight Puppy Mills</h4>
    <li>Approximately 90% of puppies you can buy in pet stores or online are from puppy mills. Adopting a dog from a shelter takes business away from mills. The more people who adopt, the more puppy mills have a hard time staying in business.</li>

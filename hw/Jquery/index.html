      <h2>Tips</h2>

      <h4>DON'T OVERCOOK YOUR NOODLES</h4>
      <p>Lasagna noodles need structure so they have a lot of ingredients layered between them! They can't be too mushy. Make sure to cook them until they're very al dente; they're ready typically two minutes before the amount of time on the box.
      </p>

      <h4>OIL 'EM UP</h4>
      <p>While you're making your beef and ricotta mixtures, your lasagna noodles will typically be hanging out in a colander, getting stuck together (worst nightmare). To prevent this, after you drain the noodles from the pasta pot, slick them
        with
        olive oil and lay them flat on a baking sheet to cool.</p>

      <h4>DRAIN BEEF</h4>
      <p>Sometimes we're in a hurry and skip this step when making a meat sauce and we always regret it, making the sauce taste so greasy! Draining the fat from the skillet is a must for your lasagna layers, which will already have a lot of fat
        from
        cheese.</p>

      <h4>SEASON YOUR RICOTTA MIXTURE</h4>
      <p>My Italian grandmother always added a secret ingredient to her lasagna: cinnamon. The ricotta mixture always gets overlooked and, therefore, tastes kinda bland. Make sure to season it generously with salt, pepper and parmesan, too!</p>

      <h4>DON'T OVER BAKE</h4>

      <p>Lasagna is one of those dishes that firms up a lot as it sets. Even though it might look like a cheesy, bubbly mess in the oven, if it's warmed all the way through it will be perfect once you let it sit for like 15 minutes. When you over
        bake
        the pasta you run the risk of the noodles drying out and getting too crispy.</p>
